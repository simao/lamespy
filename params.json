{"name":"Lamespy","tagline":"Track your location using your android phone","body":"# Lamespy\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simao/lamespy/master/lamespy_icon_180.png\" alt=\"Lamespy icon\"/>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nLamespy keeps a history of where you have been without depending on a\r\ncommercial company.\r\n\r\n# Purpose\r\n\r\nLamespy keeps a history of your location without using any external\r\nlocation API besides your android Wifi antenna.\r\n\r\nThis means that you do not depend on a commercial company to keep a\r\nhistory of the places you have been.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to do anything, lamespy works in the background and\r\nchecks your Wifi networks, you don't need to \"check-in\" or manually\r\nupdate your current location. This makes it really flawless and easy\r\nto use, you don't need to remember to do anything.\r\n\r\nLamespy app allows you to track how much time you spend in each place you\r\ngo in your life. For example, how many hours did you spend working\r\nlast week? How many times did you go to the supermarket?\r\n\r\nNot using any location API means that you need to setup the app with the\r\nlocations you want to track. If you don't add these locations,\r\n`lamespy` will not track your location on that place.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n- Privacy - Since you don't depend on a external API, your history is\r\n  kept on your android.\r\n\r\n- Easy Export and analyze - You can easily export your location\r\n  history in JSON format and analyze it with other tools that you use\r\n  every day.\r\n\r\n- Automatically saves your location, no need to \"check-in\" anywhere to\r\n  get badges.\r\n\r\n- Easily check where you have been using your android\r\n\r\nNothing else.\r\n\r\n# It's probably not for you\r\n\r\nThis app is probably not for you. It is a very bare bones app to track\r\nyour history so you can analyze it later, it does not do anything\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n# What this app does\r\n\r\nTracks your location history. That's it.\r\n\r\n# What this app does not\r\n\r\nEverything not listed above.\r\n\r\nIn particular, it only deals with data collection. Your data will be\r\navailable as a JSON file and you can analyze it any way you want, but\r\nthis app won't do that for you.\r\n\r\n# Permissions needed\r\n\r\n- `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` It needs this permission so it can listen to Wifi\r\n  events after the phone is booted.\r\n\r\n- `CHANGE_WIFI_STATE, ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE, ACCESS_WIFI_STATE`\r\n  Required to get information about Wifi networks around you. Lamespy\r\n  will also periodically trigger a Wifi scan so it can update your\r\n  location.\r\n\r\n# How to build\r\n\r\nLamespy is built using gradle, so you can run:\r\n\r\n` ./gradlew assemble`\r\n\r\nAfter this command runs successfully a new apk will be available in\r\n`./lamespy/build/apk/lamespy-release-unsigned.apk`.\r\n\r\n# How to install\r\n\r\nAfter building the apk with gradle you can upload it to your android.\r\n\r\n# Missing features\r\n\r\n- Analyzing data. You will need to write a tool that can read JSON so\r\n  you can analyze your data.\r\n\r\n# Install\r\n\r\nCurrently Lamespy is not on android market, so you need to build it\r\nand install it yourself.\r\n\r\n# Contribute\r\n\r\nThere is no minimum pull request size, all PR will be considered\r\nregardless of size. If you want to help but don't know where to start,\r\nhere are some ideas:\r\n\r\n- Write tests and setup a framework\r\n\r\n- Implement manually deleting events from the current history\r\n\r\n- Stop tracking for X of hours\r\n\r\n- UI can easily be improved\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
